Hi, Iâ€™m James Bongers! (or @jamesfbdev).

I've been in luxury wine hospitality for 10 years! Now I'm learning to code. 

freeCodeCamp really got me on the path to learning after completing their 300-hour Responsive Web Design course. I'm now enrolled in Altcademy's Full Stack boot camp. 
GitHub has been a commonly mentioned topic on the podcasts I've been listening to. And I'm here to be involved!
