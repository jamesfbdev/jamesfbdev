Hi, Iâ€™m James Bongers! (or @jamesfbdev).

I've been in luxury wine hospitality for 10 years ! Now I'm learning to code. 

freeCodeCamp really got me on the path to learning after completing their 300h Responsive Web Design course. I'm now enrolled in altcademy's Full Stack boot camp. 
Github has been a commonly mentioned topic on the podcasts I've been listening too. And I'm here to be involved!
